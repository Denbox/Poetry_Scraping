Collecting Poetry PNGs for Historical Data Analysis

Poetry Foundation's robots.txt does not prohibit collection of its archive. This tool slowly collects pages of poem volumes from the archive, stored as PNGs, with the goal of saving a more explicity corpus of the poems for data science work.

To use this scraper, you need python 3, as well as the lxml and requests packages.
